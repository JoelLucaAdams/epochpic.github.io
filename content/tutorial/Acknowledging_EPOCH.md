## How do I acknowledge use of the code? {#how-do-i-acknowledge-use-of-the-code}

There is a paper[^1] which details many aspects of the **EPOCH**
implementation and also includes useful information on current PIC
codes. This paper is OpenAccess so freely available to all. If using
EPOCH in your research output please use this as the reference for EPOCH
and ideally also acknowledge the UK grant which funded this work. The
BibTeX entry for this paper is as follows.
