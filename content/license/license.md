EPOCH is freely available under GPLv3 the details of which are below. For academic use this imposes no restrictions on your use of EPOCH. 

In addition to abiding by the GPL licensing rules all users should acknowledge the EPOCH project in any publications or documents where EPOCH has been used. There are two ways that EPOCH should be acknowldged, and both are needed, 

1. Reference the key paper which describes the core of EPOCH. This is reference is: T. D. Arber et al. ‘Contemporary particle-in-cell approach to laser-plasma modeling’ Plasma Physics & Controlled Fusion, 57 (2015) 113001. 

2. Any publication which has used EPOCH should also acknowldge the funding which helped develope the code. An example acknowledgement sentence is 'The EPOCH code used in this work was in part funded by the UK EPSRC grants EP/G054950/1, EP/G056803/1, EP/G055165/1, EP/ M022463/1 and EP/P02212X/1'.

These citations and acknowledgements are important as they help continue the funding stream which maintains and extends EPOCH

Finally if you your of EPOCH has lead to an impact outside of academia then we may occassional ask for a letter of support to maintain EPOCH funding.
